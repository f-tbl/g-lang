# G - LANG
A Javascript syntax that can be compiled.

## Why G
The real name of G-Lang is Genesis Era Programming Language (GEPL). We called it G-Lang because it sounded more *juicy* (You can also call it Genesis).
We called Genesis Era as a reference Terry A. Devis <3.


## Syntaxis
The syntaxis is meant to be exactly the same as Javascript. Also have the same keywords, utilities and everything JS provides.

### Why Javascript
I have been programming in JS for the last 8 years and I have discovered that there isn't a language that provides an easy syntax (Like JS/Python/LUA) and being compiled at the same time (Like Rust/C/C++). This leads into people programming shit in Python and ElectronJS which leads into slower and heavy apps.
But hey! Don't get me wrong! Interpreted languages are pretty good for a lot a of uses! But people are creating wrappers every-f*ckn-where!

### WHAT ABOUT THE TYPE SECURITY AND BLABLA
Well I really doubt about doing this language because of the dynamic types shit and security. But then I remembered that many servers are made with JS runtimes (NodeJS) and that C/C++ are inscure as fuck. But I probably will add a "inmut" or something like that to force a variable to be a type (or add TS support, call me microsoft ☎️ pls).

## TO DO

- Finish the base lexer.
- kill myself because LLVM and ES2024 are difficult as fuck and I don't really know how to use Rust perfectly
